        <h2> Welcome to our creamery!</h2>

          <p>Ice cream has a long and varied past. You can read more about it in our
          "<a href='http://www.almanac.com/content/history-ice-cream' title= 'History
          of Ice Cream'>History of Ice Cream</a>" section linked above. You can read
          more about our flavors and such below.</p>

        <h2>Our History</h2>
          <p> In 1928, a celebrated San Francisco tradition began.  George Whitney
           placed a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream between two freshly baked
           large old-fashioned oatmeal cookies, and then dipped the sandwich into
           fine dark chocolate.  The delicious combination of savory sweetness
           was declared by all to be “IT!”  That how the IT’S-IT Ice Cream
           Sandwich was born and got its unforgettable name, being sold in
           droves exclusively in San Francisco’s own legendary Playland-at-the-Beach
           for over four decades. </p>
          <p> When Playland was demolished in the early 1970s, IT’S-IT sandwiches
          began being individually handmade in a small shop in San Francisco’s
          SOMA district under new ownership.  The hunger for IT’S-IT exploded.
          In order to quench San Francisco’s craving for our remarkably tasty
          ice cream treat, the company relocated to a larger facility in 1976. </p>
          <p> In the 1980s, the demand for IT'S-IT grew outside of the Bay Area.
          Currently, IT'S-IT Ice Cream Sandwiches are now enjoyed widely in
          California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, Arizona, Texas and New York.
          Via our website, it is now available to be shipped throughout the United States. </p>
